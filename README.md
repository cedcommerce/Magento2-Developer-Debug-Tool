# Magento 2 Developer-Debug Tool by CedCommerce 


**Magento 2 Developer-Debug Tool**, a Magento 2.0 development and debugging extension, which aims at easing developers concerns by fetching vital information for a current page load. The extension users are provided with complete set of data related to a current page request, collections and models called during a page load. Besides this, all observer called events data, along with parent and its extended classes of a page load are viewable by developers. Further, data information on blocks with their respective handle names, and associated template files with full file path is also communicated to the extension users.
However, in the absence of **Magento 2 Developer-Debug Tool**, developers are tasked with tracking of all important data via Magento’s backend. 
The data in the module has been divided into tabs, which can be viewed at module’s bottom page, after it’s being configured from the admin section. Each tab is designed to allow developers to have better understanding on data related to the current page load.
